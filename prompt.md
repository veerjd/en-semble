Build a nuxt3 project with a supabase backend (for auth and db) where the auth is only available by email+password

Generally: The app will match users in the same space together by interest. This is a social match, not a romantic match.

Specifically: a user can only belong to one Space (at the beginning, but in the future, more than one). Interests will be user-generated and will be shared across all spaces. A space is a pool of users that will be allowed to be matched with each other; no matches across different spaces. Spaces are invite-only. I also want the slug of the space to be in the url path. Users cannot access Spaces they aren't a part of. Matches will be generated by the product; no browsing and making your own matches. Users will each have a username. Matches should be accepted by both parties before they can chat together. Matched users will have a chat page (Messenger-style) that will leverage real-time capabilities of supabase

Build primevue components for it

Use Actions+DTOs for the server-side

There should be a few pages:

Login
Register (predefined space, since invite-only)
Profile (to modify your interests and username)
Potential matches (to see if any potential matches are found and if you want to accept a found match)
A chat page for each match
Invite page to add people into the space (accessible by anyone in the Space at the beginning) where you can add a bunch of emails to send them an invite all at once
Only Login and Register don't require authentification
